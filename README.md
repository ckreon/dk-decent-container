# voaty-mcboat-space

This is a repo with tar ball images of docker containers for a web-app stack and mysql stack

these should give you a quick and easy method for spinning up the services to hack on. 

Please read this https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/ it will tell you how to mount local folders into the container.

Just unzip and run and you will have a clean microservice stack that's ready to roll.
