So This is it, the famed container.

It's currently in a bit of a .... fluid state.

I will need some assistance in cleaning up where files are, how the service starts etc, please clone this, work out where things are supposed to be, and let me know!

application < All live code should go here 

nginx < all webserver / proxy / load balancing and other fancy stuff goes here

postgres < the database goes here

voat < any new code from Cights repo, please clone it to here and then copy it to application to make it live 

  (messy I know, but until we have a rolling lifescycle and we are updating the container, it's the only solution I have)
  
  
#Do not rename decent-container unless you want to have a sad day and break all of the containers ;)
